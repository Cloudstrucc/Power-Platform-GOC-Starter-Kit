# {ORGANIZATION} Product Releases

> [!TIP]
> This section provides you with {ORGANIZATION}'s product releases. This includes, the portal themes, portal extensions, d365 solutions, model-driven and canvas apps, ALM artefacts, B2C technical profiles and much more. You can subscribe to be notified of all future releases and can opt to be notifed of release updates on each product, so you can select those for which you are most interested in. For client specific releases, you need access to your organization's documentation pages. To gain access to your organization's product releases, you can get contact customer-service@{ORGANIZATION}.com. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> When downloading releases, make sure to carefully read and follow the configuration instructions. For some of the artefacts, especially the PowerPlatform ones (in particular portal themes/extensions, and d365 solutions), depending on your set up, you may overwrite your own cutomized changes to the same elements being deployed from one of our releases. So make sure that you leverage GIT (or any code versioning system) to review and action any merge conflicts. We are not responsbile for unwanted overrides in your tenant as this is your responsiblity. However, {ORGANIZATION} does offer SLA's with organizations, and you can opt to subscribe to an SLA whereby a technical specialist will be responsbile to help you deploy new releases, help unblock any roadblocks, and participate in the merging of the release(s) with your technical team.
