# Government of Canada Power Platform Theme Documentation

Welcome to the {ORGANIZATION} Documentation website. You will be able to browse through all of our product and services documentation. For organization specific documentation, you will need to be a registered user.

> [!TIP]
> To become a registered user contact (TBD) - for other inquiries please visit our website [website's contact us page here](https://{ORGANIZATION}.canada.ca/contact-contactez/1-eng)

> [!TIP]
> Our goal is to provide our customers with the most up to date and relevant documentation surrounding the various products and services we support. Despite our strong focus to using PAAS and SAAS services, which are already well documented online, it is often a challenge to find the most relevant information based on the specific implemementation details of what our company has deployed to your environment(s).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The way to authenticate to access our private documentation related to your organization's implementation is through your Azure AD account that is federated with your on-premises active directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each customer has a dedicated site for documentation, the site is not hosted in a shared infrastructure model. Instead, each site has its own hosting boundary and network security group making it impossible for other users who are registered to this site to ever access another customer's documentation.
