* FieldName: The Rollup field Name of the parent entity.
* Parent RecordURL: You must to select the Parent field called Record URL

Note: The Parent Record URL, is a standard feature of Dynamics CRM, taht contains the full URL of a record. In this URL you have the entity type, and the record GUID. Right now this is the only way we have to pass a "Dynamic" EntityReference (with not hard coding an entity type) to Workflows Activities. If you pass this string URL as a parameter, in the Workflow Activity you can retrieve this entity Reference.

Done! you can execute or launch your Workflows with this new feature!
